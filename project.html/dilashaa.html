          <h1>J.K ROWLING:The author of Harry Potter</h1>
          <div class="jk2">
         <p>Joanne Rowling CH OBE FRSL (born 31 July 1965), better known by her pen name 
            J. K. Rowling, is a British author and philanthropist. She wrote Harry Potter, a seven-volume fantasy 
            series published from 1997 to 2007. The series has sold over 600 million copies, been translated into
             84 languages, and spawned a global media franchise including films and video games. The Casual Vacancy 
             (2012) was her first novel for adults. She writes Cormoran Strike, an ongoing crime fiction series, 
             under the alias Robert Galbraith.

            Born in Yate, Gloucestershire, Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for 
            Amnesty International in 1990 when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series. The seven-year 
            period that followed saw the death of her mother, the birth of her first child, divorce from her first
             husband, and relative poverty until the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's 
             Stone, was published in 1997. Six sequels followed, concluding with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
             (2007). By 2008, Forbes had named her the world's highest-paid author.The novels follow a boy 
             called Harry Potter as he attends Hogwarts (a school for wizards), and battles Lord Voldemort.
              Death and the divide between good and evil are the central themes of the series. Its influences 
              include Bildungsroman (the coming-of-age genre), school stories, fairy tales, and Christian 
              allegory. The series revived fantasy as a genre in the children's market, spawned a host of
               imitators, and inspired an active fandom. Critical reception has been more mixed. Many reviewers
                see Rowling's writing as conventional; some regard her portrayal of gender and social division
                 as regressive. There were also religious debates over the Harry Potter series.
